   Based on your income, a debt collector could make you pay **${ currency(amount_not_exempt(jobs_and_fully_exempt) + fully_non_exempt(non_job_income))}** per week.

     Remember, if your home is foreclosed on or your car is reposessed, the company you
     borrowed money from to buy your home or your car can **almost always** take and
     sell your home or car without going to court first. **They can also still sue you
